## Project Overview
In this project, we have to analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it.
We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

What do I need to install?
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
>* pandas
>* NumPy
>* Matplotlib
>* csv
>* seaborn
>* sklearn



### Why this Project?
>In this project, we have to go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.
I have also use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! 
I try two Anomly Detection Approaches {Graph approach ,Density approach (LOF)}

### What I have learn?
>After completing the project, I have learned following :

>>* Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
>>* Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
>>* Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
>>* Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
>>* Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
>>* Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
>>* Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
>>* Anomly Detection using two Approaches {Graph approach ,Density approach (LOF)}
>>* Predictive analysis Using Two models (Linear Regression Model "using both Single and Multiple Features " , Decsion Tree Model)
